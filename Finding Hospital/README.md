## Changes in website
Initally the requirement was to fill valid and invalid details in corporate wellness page and capture the alerts.
Now since the webpage is updated and the alerts are removed we had to impovise and test the enablement of "Schedule a demo" button.
The project focuses on testing the enablement of the button by entering valid and invalid value in respective fields.
